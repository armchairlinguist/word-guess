# word-guess

The operation of this little script is based on https://hryanjones.com/guess-my-word/, although I didn't use the code itself at all. I just saw it and thought "I bet I could write a CLI version of that", and I don't feel that way very often, so I decided to try it.

It's not exactly the same:

* it doesn't have an easy mode.
* as written it only works on Mac or any other platform that puts the wordlist in `/usr/share`.
* it doesn't have the cool way of showing all your guesses, though it does show the two most recent on either side.

I think it's pretty okay, though!
